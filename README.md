# News-Classification
This repository explores various algorithms for classifying Persian news articles. We compare different methods for converting sentences into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models. These methods include:

1. Bag of Words
2. TF-IDF
3. Word2vec
4. ParsBERT
   
Our experiments show that ParsBERT, combined with a Gradient Boosting classifier, achieves the highest F1 score for news article classification. Conversely, Word2vec with a Naive Bayes classifier results in the lowest F1 score.
